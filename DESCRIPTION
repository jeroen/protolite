Author: Jeroen Ooms

Description: Optimized C++ implementations for reading and writing protocol-buffers.
    Currently supports rexp.proto for serializing R objects and geobuf.proto for
    geojson data. This lightweight package is complementary to the much larger
    'RProtoBuf' package which provides a full featured toolkit for working with
    protocol-buffers in R.
