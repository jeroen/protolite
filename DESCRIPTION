Title: Fast and Simple Object Serialization to Protocol Buffers
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen@berkeley.edu>
Description: Optimized C++ implementations for reading and writing common protocol-buffers
    formats. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for serializing R objects, 'geobuf.proto' for 
    binary geojson, and 'mvt.proto' for "Mapbox vector tiles". This package uses auto-generated 
    C++ interfaces from protobuf-compiler, hence the entire serialization is highly optimized. 
    The 'RProtoBuf' package on the other hand provides a general-purpose toolkit for 
    working with arbitrary protocol-buffers in R.
